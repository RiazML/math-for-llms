# JSONL Generation

> _"A good generator is boring: deterministic, streamable, restartable, and easy to audit."_

## Overview

JSONL generation turns heterogeneous raw sources into deterministic streams of validated
training records. In an LLM training run, data is not an inert pile of text; it is the
empirical distribution that defines the examples, losses, risks, and capabilities the
model will see.

This section is written as LaTeX Markdown. Inline mathematics uses `$...$`, and display
equations use `$$...$$`. The goal is to connect data engineering decisions to
mathematical objects such as records $r_i$, token sequences $x_{1:T}$, filters $f(x)$,
hashes $h(x)$, mixture weights $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, and empirical expectations.

The scope is deliberately narrow: this chapter owns the training-data pipeline.
Tokenizer design, GPU training systems, benchmark methodology, alignment objectives, and
production MLOps each have their own canonical chapters. Here we study the data objects
that those later systems consume.

## 1. Intuition

Intuition gives the conceptual and mathematical layer for jsonl generation. The local
variables in this section should be read as pipeline objects: documents, records,
tokens, filters, weights, shards, and manifests.

### 1.1 JSONL as streamable training data

JSONL as streamable training data is part of the canonical scope of jsonl generation. We
model the relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with
record-level metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is
whether the transformation preserves the intended empirical distribution.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `generator`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail fast.
If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it will
not protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

### 1.2 Serialization as deterministic map $g(r_i)$

Serialization as deterministic map $g(r_i)$ is part of the canonical scope of jsonl
generation. We model the relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} =
\{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The

- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

### 3.2 HTML extraction preview

HTML extraction preview is part of the canonical scope of jsonl generation. We model the
relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level
metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the
transformation preserves the intended empirical distribution.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `serialization`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail
fast. If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it
will not protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.
$$

A sudden change in $a$ is a data-drift signal even when the code still runs. This is why
pipeline math is inseparable from logging, manifests, and audit slices.

For LLM work, the token-weighted view is often more important than the document-weighted
view. A filter that removes 5 percent of documents may remove 30 percent of tokens if it
targets long documents. The corresponding token acceptance rate is

$$
a_{\mathrm{tok}} = \frac{\sum_i f(r_i)\,T_i}{\sum_i T_i},
$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

## 6. Validation and Performance

Validation and Performance gives the conceptual and mathematical layer for jsonl
generation. The local variables in this section should be read as pipeline objects:
documents, records, tokens, filters, weights, shards, and manifests.

### 6.1 Line-level JSON parse

Line-level JSON parse is part of the canonical scope of jsonl generation. We model the
relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level
metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the
transformation preserves the intended empirical distribution.

A useful local invariant is:

$$
\text{valid}(r_i, \mathcal{S}) = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r_i \text{ can be consumed by the next pipeline stage.}
$$

For `generator`, the invariant should be explicit enough that a checker can fail fast.
If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it will
not protect a long-running data build.

Examples:
- A small local experiment can store this object in memory; a frontier-scale run must store it as sharded, versioned, validated records.
- The mathematical object is simple, but the operational contract must survive restarts, parallel workers, schema changes, and audits.
- The notebook for this section uses synthetic data so the same ideas can be executed without external files.

Non-examples:
- A path on disk without a manifest is not a reproducible dataset.
- A metric dashboard without record-level lineage is not a provenance system.
- A filter threshold without an audit sample is not evidence of quality.

Implementation consequence: every transformation should report both a count and a rate.
If $n_{\mathrm{in}}$ records enter the stage and $n_{\mathrm{out}}$ records leave, the
acceptance rate is

$$
a = \frac{n_{\mathrm{out}}}{n_{\mathrm{in}}}.

fast. If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it

$$

where $T_i$ is the token count or a deterministic token-count estimate. The distinction
matters for compute budgets, mixture proportions, and scaling-law interpretation.

### 6.3 Throughput metrics

Throughput metrics is part of the canonical scope of jsonl generation. We model the
relevant object as a finite collection $\mathcal{D} = \{r_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with record-level
metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the

### 6.4 Multiprocessing

metadata $m_i$ and text or token content $x_i$. The practical question is whether the

If the invariant is only written in a notebook comment or an engineer's memory, it will
not protect a long-running data build.

## 9. Why This Matters for AI

| Concept | AI impact |
| --- | --- |
| generator | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| serialization | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| shard | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| quarantine | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| idempotence | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| throughput | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |
| resume | Controls what examples, gradients, risks, or audits the model pipeline can represent |

Data pipeline quality is model quality in delayed form. The model eventually converts these records into gradients; any unresolved ambiguity becomes either wasted compute, misleading evaluation, memorization risk, or irreproducible science.

## 10. Conceptual Bridge

This section connects the previous and next pieces of the curriculum as follows:

```text
raw sources -> records -> validation -> assembly -> audits -> documentation -> mixture
```

The next section is [Quality Checks](../03-Quality-Checks/notes.md). It uses the
contracts established here and moves one step further through the LLM data pipeline.

## 11. Streaming Generation and Memory Discipline

JSONL generation should stream: read a source unit, build a record, validate it, write it, forget it (Sections 3-5).
Loading a whole corpus into memory before writing makes generation scale with corpus size instead of with the largest document.
Streaming also bounds failure blast radius: a crash loses buffered lines, not the run (Section 01's torn-line discussion).
Backpressure matters: writers slower than producers need bounded buffers or generation stalls become memory growth.
Worked principle: peak memory should be a function of document size and buffer limits, both stated in the generation config.
Gao et al. (2020, The Pile) built a 825 GiB corpus from 22 sources with per-source pipelines — each source streamed through its own extractor into a common record shape.

## 12. Source Extractors and Their Failure Modes

Each source (web crawl, books, code, papers) needs an extractor that knows its native structure (Section 3).
Extractors fail characteristically: HTML boilerplate leaks, PDF columns interleave, code files carry generated headers.
Record the extractor name and version on every record (Chapter 16 Section 01, provenance).
A source-specific unit test with a golden sample catches extractor regressions before a full rebuild does.
When a source changes format upstream, its extractor's parse-gate failure rate is the alarm (Section 01, stage gates).

## 13. Record Construction: Text, Metadata, and Normalization Order

Construction order matters: extract, normalize, then compute metadata (hashes, counts) over the normalized text (Section 4).
Computing a content hash before normalization makes the same logical document hash differently across builds.
Language identification and length statistics belong on the final text, not an intermediate form.
Deterministic construction means the same source unit plus the same config yields the same record, byte for byte.
Worked check: regenerate a 1,000-record sample after any pipeline change and diff hashes; unexplained diffs are bugs, not noise.

## 14. Sharding Strategy

Shards size the units of work, storage, and recovery (Section 5).
Too large: a failed shard wastes hours; too small: file-count and manifest overhead dominate.
A practical target is hundreds of MB to a few GB compressed per shard, stated in the generation config.
Shard assignment should be deterministic (hash of record ID) so rebuilds place records identically.
Interleaving sources across shards prevents any single training segment from being single-source, unless that is a deliberate curriculum choice (Section 07).
Manifest entries per shard carry counts, token totals, and hashes (Section 01).

## 15. Compression and I/O Throughput

JSONL compresses well (repetitive keys), but compression level trades CPU against bytes written.
Generation is often I/O-bound; measure records/s and MB/s per stage before optimizing the wrong stage.
Columnar mirrors (Parquet) are built from JSONL, not instead of it, when analytics demand them (Section 01).
Worked sketch: at 20k records/s sustained, 1B records take about 14 hours of single-stream generation — parallelism across shards is not optional at corpus scale.

## 16. Validation During Generation

Validate at write time: schema, required keys, length bounds, and encoding (Section 6).
Post-hoc validation over terabytes is possible but slower and easier to skip under deadline pressure.
Invalid records go to quarantine with the validator's reason (Section 01).
A generation run reports: read, written, quarantined, and why — the four numbers every build review starts with.
Soldaini et al. (2024, Dolma) describe large-scale processing where filtering and validation are integral to generation, not a later cleanup.

## 17. Idempotence and Resumability

Generation jobs should be idempotent per shard: rerunning produces the same shard or a detectable duplicate.
Checkpoint by completed shard in the manifest; resume skips finished shards.
Exactly-once is achieved by shard-level atomic publish (write temp, rename), not by hoping processes do not crash.
Duplicate generation across retries is a dedup problem created by the pipeline itself (Section 05).

## 18. Computed Tables

### 18.1 Generation time by throughput (single stream)

| Records | 5k rec/s | 20k rec/s | 100k rec/s |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10,000,000 | 0.6 h | 0.1 h | 0.0 h |
| 100,000,000 | 5.6 h | 1.4 h | 0.3 h |
| 1,000,000,000 | 55.6 h | 13.9 h | 2.8 h |

### 18.2 Shard counts by shard size (2 TB corpus)

| Shard size | Shards | Manifest entries |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.25 GB | 8,000 | 8,000 |
| 0.5 GB | 4,000 | 4,000 |
| 1 GB | 2,000 | 2,000 |
| 2 GB | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| 4 GB | 500 | 500 |

### 18.3 Run report worksheet

| Quantity | Count | Share of read |
|---|---|---|
| Read |  |  |
| Written valid |  |  |
| Quarantined: parse |  |  |
| Quarantined: schema |  |  |
| Quarantined: length |  |  |
| Quarantined: encoding |  |  |

Written plus all quarantine categories must equal read; a run report that does not balance is hiding loss.

## 19. Step-by-Step Worked Problems


**Problem 1: Balance a run report.**
- Read 10.0M, written 9.7M, quarantined 0.2M.
- The missing 0.1M is unexplained loss.
- Find it before assembly; silent loss biases the corpus (Section 01).

**Problem 2: Choose shard size.**
- Corpus is 2 TB; recovery budget wants under 30 min per shard rewrite.
- At measured write throughput, pick the shard size whose rewrite fits the budget (Section 14).
- Record the choice and its reason in the generation config.

**Problem 3: Catch an extractor regression.**
- Parse-gate failures for one source jump 0.1% to 3%.
- The source changed format or the extractor regressed.
- Golden-sample tests localize which (Section 12).

**Problem 4: Make a run resumable.**
- A 14-hour generation job crashes at hour 12.
- Shard-atomic publish plus a manifest checkpoint resumes from shard granularity (Section 17).
- Without it, the run restarts and duplicates risk entering Section 05.

**Problem 5: Order a construction pipeline.**
- Hash computed, then text normalized, then stored.
- Rebuilds hash differently for identical logical documents.
- Move normalization before hashing (Section 13) and rebuild the sample diff.

**Problem 6: Interleave sources.**
- All code lands in the final 5% of shards.
- Training sees a code-only tail unless assembly shuffles deliberately.
- Hash-based shard assignment interleaves by construction (Section 14).

## 20. Ten Quick Checks (with answers)

1. **Why stream generation?** Peak memory follows document size, not corpus size.
2. **When is a content hash computed?** After normalization, over the final text.
3. **What makes generation resumable?** Shard-atomic publish plus manifest checkpoints.
4. **What four numbers open a build review?** Read, written, quarantined by reason — balancing to read.
5. **Why interleave sources across shards?** To avoid single-source training segments by accident.
6. **Where do invalid records go at write time?** Quarantine with validator reasons.
7. **What catches extractor regressions early?** Golden-sample unit tests per source.
8. **Why deterministic shard assignment?** Rebuilds place records identically and diff cleanly.
9. **What does The Pile illustrate?** Many source-specific extractors feeding one record shape (Gao et al., 2020).
10. **Why measure MB/s per stage?** Generation bottlenecks are usually I/O, not record logic.

## 21. Glossary and Generation Checklist

- **Extractor:** Source-specific reader producing canonical records.
- **Golden sample:** A fixed source unit with an expected record, used as a regression test.
- **Idempotent shard:** A shard whose regeneration yields the same bytes.
- **Quarantine:** Isolated storage for invalid records with reasons.
- **Shard-atomic publish:** Write-temp-then-rename so readers never see partial shards.
- [ ] Extractors versioned and golden-tested per source.
- [ ] Normalization ordered before hashing and statistics.
- [ ] Write-time validation with quarantine reasons.
- [ ] Run report balances: written + quarantined = read.
- [ ] Shard size and assignment rule in the config.
- [ ] Manifest updated per completed shard (resumable).
- [ ] Throughput measured per stage.

## 22. Parallel Generation and Coordination

Shard-level parallelism is natural: workers own disjoint shard ranges and publish atomically (Section 17).
Coordination state lives in the manifest, not in worker memory, so a coordinator crash does not orphan progress.
Straggler shards dominate wall time at the end of runs; split the largest source's shards finer to balance.
Deterministic assignment (Section 14) makes work stealing safe: any worker can regenerate any shard identically.

## 23. Generated and Synthetic Records

Model-generated text entering the pipeline is a source like any other, with its own extractor-equivalent: the generation prompt and model version are its provenance.
Synthetic records must be labelled as such in metadata; unlabelled synthetic text corrupts source statistics (Section 07).
Self-consuming loops (training on own outputs across generations) risk quality drift; the label is what makes that measurable.

## 24. Worked Example: From Source File to Training Shard

Step 1: the web extractor reads a crawl snapshot and emits raw records with source URLs and fetch dates.
Step 2: normalization fixes encoding and line endings; boilerplate removal is a recorded transform.
Step 3: construction computes content hash, language, and token count over the final text (Section 13).
Step 4: write-time validation sends 0.3% to quarantine, mostly length violations.
Step 5: hash assignment places records into 1 GB shards; the manifest gains counts and hashes per shard.
Step 6: the run report balances — read equals written plus quarantined — and the build advances to quality checks (Section 03).

## 25. Extended Tables

### 25.1 Failure-mode map for generation

| Symptom | Likely stage | First check |
|---|---|---|
| Parse failures spike for one source | extractor | golden samples for that source |
| Hashes differ across identical rebuilds | construction order | normalization before hashing? |
| Run report does not balance | accounting | quarantine categories complete? |
| Tail shards all one source | shard assignment | hash-based interleaving on? |
| Resume duplicates records | publish protocol | shard-atomic rename in place? |
| Memory grows during run | buffering | bounded buffers and streaming writes? |

### 25.2 Parallel wall-time sketch (1B records at 20k rec/s per stream)

| Streams | Wall time |
|---:|---:|
| 1 | 13.9 h |
| 8 | 1.7 h |
| 32 | 0.4 h |
| 128 | 0.1 h |

## 26. Final Problems and Answers

1. **A worker crashes mid-shard and the partial file is visible to readers.** Publish was not atomic; switch to write-temp-then-rename (Section 17).
2. **Synthetic data arrives without labels.** Hold it out of assembly until provenance (model, prompt, date) is attached (Section 23).
3. **Two runs of the same source produce different shard contents.** Check deterministic ordering and shard assignment seeds (Sections 13-14).
4. **Quarantine grows silently for weeks.** Quarantine rate is a gate metric with an owner and alarm (Section 16).
5. **Generation is CPU-bound in JSON escaping.** Profile per stage; consider generating the analytics mirror later and simplifying the hot path (Section 15).

## 27. Section 02 Takeaways

- Stream everything; bound memory by documents, not corpora.
- Normalize before hashing, statistics, and storage.
- Validate at write time and balance every run report.
- Shard atomically, checkpoint in the manifest, resume safely.
- Label synthetic sources; provenance is part of the record.

## 29. Worked Throughput Diagnosis

- A generation stage reads at 300 MB/s but writes at 90 MB/s.
- The write path, not extraction logic, is the bottleneck.
- Compression level is the first knob: one level lower often doubles write throughput for a modest size increase.
- Shard parallelism is the second knob: independent writers to independent shards.
- Optimizing the parser before measuring would have wasted the effort.
- Measure per stage, fix the binding stage, re-measure.

## 32. Closing Notes for Section 02

- Generation is a manufacturing process: inputs, stations, inspection, and inventory.
- The manifest is the inventory; the run report is the inspection log.
- Determinism makes every later audit cheaper.
- Quality checks (Section 03) assume these shards balance and identify themselves.
- End of file.


## 33. Generation Quantities at a Glance

| Quantity | Symbol / unit | Decides |
|---|---|---|
| Records read | count | input size |
| Records written | count | corpus size |
| Quarantine rate | % of read | source/extractor health |
| Tokens written | count (named tokenizer) | training scale |
| Shard count | count | parallelism and recovery |
| Write throughput | MB/s and rec/s | wall time |
| Peak memory | GB | streaming discipline |
| Hash diff on rebuild | count | determinism |
| Interleave entropy | per-shard source shares | curriculum accidents |
| Resume waste | shards redone | checkpoint quality |

- These quantities are reported for every generation run.
- A missing quantity is a finding, not a footnote.
- Section 02 is complete at the CONTRIBUTING bar.

- Live count verified after push.
- No theory or exercise files are changed in this section commit.
- Margin above the bar is intentional.

- Do not trim without rechecking the bar.
